## Preface

It is the 14th of September. After working for several days, I have composed a website with the following technologies:
- TypeScript
- React
- Gatsby
  - Configs
  - Plugins

In this writeup, I will detail on each and every one of these technologies, and their configuration in this project.

Now, you might ask, "why would you do a whole writeup about a website?"

Well, once either hand in or present this at the end of the 9-week period, you, the teachers, will be shown the *built version* of the project.
This means that you will have no *visible* idea of what's behind it, or the amount of work I've put into it. ~~or the pain I've been through.~~

This writeup will aim to explain the project in an intricate manner, in the hopes of making my efforts possible to understand.

## Chapter 1: The Technologies

### TypeScript

As the homepage states:

[TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) is **JavaScript with syntax for types.**
It is a strongly typed programming language which builds on JavaScript giving you better tooling at any scale.

<!-- TODO: Write more about TypeScript -->

### React
